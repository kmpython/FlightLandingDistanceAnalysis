# FlightLandingDistanceAnalysis

This dataset has been obtained by Federal Aviation Administration which contains flight data. We have the following variables:
- Aircraft
- Speed_ground
- Speed_air
- Pitch
- Duration
- No_pasg
- Height
- Distance

In this exercise I am performing a linear and polynomial regression to determine the landing distance (considering it as the dependent variable) taking the other variables as independent variables.
I also got to learn concepts like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Data Prepartation, Training and Testing data, fitting a model etc.

I gained experience in using packages like
- Pandas
- Numpy
- ScikitLearn

And Machine Learning Algorithms like
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
